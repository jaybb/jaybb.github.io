			<div class="topic"><em>1.</em> Replacement of Boundary Line with 3 Nautical Miles:</div>
			This update replaces the term &#8220;Boundary Line&#8221; with &#8220;3 Nautical Miles&#8221; and is defined as &#8220;3 nautical miles from the baseline from which the territorial sea of the United States is measured or 3 nautical miles from the coastline of the Great Lakes.&#8221;* This establishes a new demarcation line for vessels subject to specific safety standards. 

			<div class="whyTitle">Why the change?</div> The &#8220;Boundary Line,&#8221; used as a demarcation line, was often confusing and its distance from shore was not uniform around the U.S. coastline. Also, it is not shown on most charts.The 3 nautical mile line is measured familiar to commercial fishermen.
		</div>


		<div class="topicContainer">
			<div class="topic"><em>2.</em> Survival Craft:</div>
			This updated regulation states &#8220;A survival craft that ensures that no part of an individual is immersed  in water...&#8221;. This will require vessels beyond 3 nautical miles to carry survival crafts that more accurately reflect the performance standard for primary lifesaving equipment.* 
			<div class="whyTitle">Why the change?</div> Life floats and buoyant apparatus do not keep an individual out of the water when used in an emergency, and are no longer considered acceptable. Survival crafts are necessary, especially in cold water areas.
		</div>


		<div class="topicContainer">
			<div class="topic"><em>3.</em> Records:</div>  This regulation states that the individual in charge of a vessel operating beyond 3 nautical miles is required to keep a record of equipment maintenance, required instruction, and drills.* 

			<div class="whyTitle">Why the change?</div> This provision will ensure there is a maintenance record documenting safety equipment testing and repair required by regulation or manufacturers &#8217; recommendations. These provisions will also ensure that required emergency instruction and drills are being conducted by a qualified individual with crew participation. It will be up to the master or individual in charge of a commercial fishing vessel to maintain these records onboard the vessel.
		</div>



		<div class="topic"><em>4.</em> Examinations and Certificates of Compliance:</div>
		 Creates a requirement that commercial fishing vessels operating beyond 3 nautical miles must be examined dockside at least once every 5 years and be issued a Certificate of Compliance (COC). The first such exam for a vessel must be completed not later than  October 15, 2015. Section 608 of the CGAA also added authority for the USCG to remove a certificate from a vessel that does not comply with its provisions. Vessels operating without a certificate required by Title 46 U.S.C. may have their voyage terminated. (Note: The CGAA requirement for a dockside examination at least once every 2 years was changed to at least once every 5 years by the CGMTA.) 

		<div class="whyTitle">Why the change?</div> Approximately only about 10% of the nation&#8217;s estimated active commercial fishing fleet is examined at the dock during a year. Studies have shown that fatalities and vessel losses occur more frequently on, or with those vessels, that have not been examined or its decal has expired. This requirement will promote safer practices onboard these vessels.


		<div class="topic"><em>5.</em> Training for Commercial Fishing Vessel Operators:</div>
		This update requires the individual in charge of a commercial fishing vessel that operates beyond 3 nautical miles to pass a training program and hold a certificate issued under that program. The program must recognize and give credit to the individual for recent past experience in fishing vessel operation. The training certificate will be valid for 5 years after which refresher training will be required to keep the certificate current.


		<div class="whyTitle">Why the change?</div> Most commercial fishing vessel operators are unlicensed. The training requirement for operators will help ensure their competency to command the vessel. Individuals in charge of a commercial fishing vessel will have to pass a training program or demonstrate knowledge and competency in seamanship, navigation and publications, collision prevention, stability, fire fighting and prevention, damage control, personal survival, emergency medical care, emergency drills, weather, and emergency communication.


		<div class="topic"><em>6.</em> Construction Standards for Newly-Built Smaller Vessels:</div>
		This update requires commercial fishing vessels less than 50 feet overall in length, built after January 1, 2010, to be constructed in a manner that provides a level of safety equivalent to the minimum safety standards established for recreational vessels.* 

		<div class="whyTitle">Why the change?</div> Construction standards imposed by this provision should improve the integrity of smaller fishing vessels, and, maintaining the vessel to original construction condition is  important to ensure better integrity of a commercial fishing vessel as it ages. Casualty data shows that  67% of vessels lost to flooding result from hull or equipment failure. Construction and maintenance standards that have been needed for smaller commercial fishing vessels are addressed by establishment of this requirement.

		<div class="note">Note:</div> &#8220;Overall in length&#8221;, means the horizontal distance of the hull between the foremost part of the stem and the aftermost part of the stern excluding fittings and attachments. This is different from the &#8220;registered length&#8221;.

		<div class="topic"><em>7.</em> Load Lines:</div>
		This update requires commercial fishing vessels 79 feet or greater in length to have a load line assigned. Under the CGAA, this provision applied to commercial fishing vessels built after July 1, 2012, however, the CGMTA changed the effective date to July 1, 2013.
		The CGAA also added a provision that requires fishing vessels that undergo a &#8220;substantial change to the dimension of or type of vessel&#8221; after July 1, 2012, or on a date set by the Coast Guard, to comply with an alternate load line compliance program developed in cooperation with the industry. Again, the effective date  for this change is July 1, 2013.
		With regard to major conversion determinations, fishing vessels are often modified such that their dimensions are changed or they are converted to a different type of commercial fishing vessel. When that action is taken, the loading conditions and seaworthiness of the vessel can be affected. Re-evaluation of the watertight integrity and safe loading capacity of the vessel may be needed and an alternate load line compliance program is to be developed by the Coast Guard in cooperation with the commercial fishing industry.
		<div class="whyTitle">Why the change?</div>  A load line indicates the minimum safe freeboard to which a vessel may be loaded. Conditions evaluated when calculating and assigning a load line include watertight integrity of the vessel, subdivision, and loading capacity. Casualty data has shown that commercial fishing vessels that are overloaded are more vulnerable to loss of stability that can lead to flooding and capsizing, particularly in severe weather or sea conditions. Having and complying with an assigned load line will help ensure safe loading and improved seaworthiness of vessels.
		
		<div class="note"> Note: </div>Major conversion is defined in 46 U.S.C. ยง 2101(14a) as meaning a conversion of a vessel that: substantially changes the dimensions (e.g. length, breadth, or depth) or carrying capacity of the vessel; changes the type of the vessel; substantially prolongs the life of the vessel; or, otherwise so changes the vessel that it is essentially a new vessel, as decided by the Commandant. Built date can be inferred from definitions provided in the U.S. Code and Regulations for &#8220;new&#8221; and &#8220;existing&#8221; vessels where determination is made based on when the keel is laid or the vessel was at a similar stage of construction. 



		<div class="topic"><em>8.</em> Classing of Vessels:</div>
		This update adds a requirement that commercial fishing vessels at least 50 feet overall in length, built after July 1, 2012 that operate beyond 3 nautical miles must be designed, constructed, and maintained to the standards of a recognized classification society. The CGAA also required that vessels classed before July 1, 2012 shall remain subject to the requirements of a classification society and have on board a certificate from that society. The 2012 CGMTA changed the effective date to July 1, 2013 after which if a vessel 50 feet or more in length is built, it must meet survey and classification requirements. 

		<div class ="note">Note:</div>The 2012 CGMTA added a subsection (e) to 46 U.S.C. ยง4503 that states the term &#8220;built&#8221; means, with respect to a vessel, that the vesselโs construction has reached any of the following stages: (1) The vessel&#8217;s keel is laid. (2) Construction identifiable with the vessel has begun and assembly of the vessel has commenced comprising of at least 50 metric tons or one percent of the estimated mass of all structural material, whichever is less.



		<div class="topic"><em>9.</em> Alternate Safety Compliance Program:</div>
		This provision requires the Coast Guard to prescribe and develop, in cooperation with the commercial fishing industry, an alternate safety compliance program for commercial fishing vessels that operate beyond the 3 nautical mile line, if the vessel: 
		is at least 50 feet overall in length, is built before July 1, 2012, and is 25 years of age or older (in 2020); or, is built on or before July 1, 2012, and undergoes a substantial change to the dimension of, or type of vessel, completed after July 1, 2012, or a later date set by the Coast Guard. 
		The 2012 CGMTA changed the dates of applicability from July 1, 2012 to July 1, 2013.
		Alternate safety compliance programs may be developed for specific regions and fisherie.In general, the alternate safety compliance programs must be prescribed by 2017 and implementation begun by 2020. 46 CFR Part 28 will be amended to reflect these requirements.

		<div class="whyTitle">Why the changes</div> Casualty data shows that approximately two thirds of commercial fishing vessels lost to flooding result from hull or equipment failure; poor maintenance is often a factor. The older the vessel, the more likely it is to experience a catastrophic event. Standards to ensure a well-built and maintained vessel and application of equivalent safety standards on older and modified commercial fishing vessels are needed to improve the safety of the vessel. 

		<div class="note">Note:</div> The meaning of &#8220;built&#8221; as described in the Note under the โClassing of Vesselsโ is also applicable to commercial fishing vessels that will be subject to alternate safety compliance programs.


		<div class="topic">Clarification of Existing Equipment Requirements:</div>
		Section 604 of the 2010 CGAA also clarified or changed certain existing equipment standards by amending parts of 46 U.S.C. ยง4502(a) and ยง4502(b) as noted in the following paragraphs. 46 CFR Part 28 will be amended to reflect these added requirements or changes to existing requirements.
		Applicable to all commercial fishing vessels:

		<div class="endPoint">46 U.S.C. ยง4502(a)</div> Was amended to add a new paragraph (6) that grants authority for the Coast Guard to require &#8220;other equipment required to minimize the risk of injury to the crew during vessel operations if the Secretary determines that a risk or serious injury exists that can be eliminated or mitigated by that equip-ment.&#8221; (This used to be found as 46 U.S.C. ยง4502(b)(2) (G) before the amendment.)
		Applicable to commercial fishing vessels operating beyond 3 nautical miles of the baseline of the territorial sea or 3 nautical miles from the coastline of the Great Lakes:
		
		<div class="endPoint">46 U.S.C. ยง4502(b)(2)(D)</div> Was amended by specifying that radio communication equipment must be &#8220;marine radios&#8221; for effective communication with land-based search and rescue facilities. This implies that cellular telephones will not be accepted as primary or second-ary emergency communication equipment.
		
		<div class="endPoint">46 U.S.C. ยง4502(b)(2)(E)</div> Was amended by striking the requirement for &#8220;radar reflectors&#8221; and &#8220;anchors.&#8221; The revision added โpublicationsโ to the requirement for navigation equipment, compasses and nautical charts. The publications may include U.S. Coast Pilot, Coast Guard Light List, tide tables, and Inland Navigation Rules.
		
		<div class="endPoint">46 U.S.C. ยง4502(b)(2)(F)</div> Was amend by replacing the requirement for &#8220;medicine chests&#8221; with &#8220;medical sup-plies sufficient for the size and area of operation of the vessel.&#8221; This will permit the development of standards for first-aid kits and other emergency medical equip-ment for vessels operating in different areas.
		
		<div class="endPoint">46 U.S.C. ยง4502(b)(2)(G)</div> Was amended to require &#8220;ground tackle sufficient for the vessel.&#8221; This would include appropriate anchoring capability for the vessel, a requirement that was deleted by the change made to ยง4502(b)(2)(E) as noted above. Further, with respect to that change, there are no standards for radar reflectors, and they may not be necessary on most vessels.
		
		<div class="whyTitle">Why the changes?</div> The impact of these changes will be to more accurately reflect equipment that is better suited for and needed in today&#8217;s commercial fishing industry for vessels based on their operating areas.
		Note: None of the above changes was affected by the CGMTA.
