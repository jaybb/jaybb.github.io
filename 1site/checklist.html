		<div class="topic"><em>1.</em> Replacement of Boundary Line with 3 Nautical Miles:</div>
		 46 U.S.C. §4502(b)(1)(A) is amended by the CGAA deleting the words “Boundary Line” and replacing them with “3 nautical miles from the baseline from which the territorial sea of the United States is measured or 3 nautical miles from the coastline of the Great Lakes.” (Note:The
		CGMTA had no effect on this provision.) This change establishes a new demarcation line for vessels subject to specific safety standards. 46 CFR Part 28 must be amended to reflect this change.
		Why the change? The “Boundary Line,” used as a de-marcation line, was often confusing and its distance from shore was not uniform around the U.S. coastline. Also, it is not shown on most charts.The 3 nautical mile line is measured familiar to commercial fishermen.
		<div class="topic"><em>2.</em> Survival Craft:</div>
		 46 U.S.C. §4502(b)(2)(B) is amended by the CGAA deleting the words “life-boats or liferafts” and replacing them with “a survival craft that ensures that no part of an indi-vidual is immersed in water...”.This will require tbeyond 3 nautical miles to carry survival craft
		that more accurately reflect the performance standard for primary lifesaving equipment. (Note: The CGMTA had no effect on this provision.) 46 CFR Part 28 must be amended to reflect this change.
		Why the change? Life floats and buoyant apparatus do not keep an individual out of the water when used in an emergency.This can be critical to survival, particularly in cold water areas.The change to the type of survival craft required means that life floats and buoyant appa-ratus will no longer be accepted as survival craft on commercial fishing vessels operating beyond 3 nautical
		3miles.
		<div class="topic"><em>3.</em> Records:</div> 46 U.S.C. §4502(f) is amended by the CGAA to add a requirement that the individual in charge of a vessel operating beyond 3 NM keep a record of equipment maintenance, and required instruction and drills. (Note:The CGMTA had no effect on this provision.) 46 CFR Part 28 will be
		amended to reflect this requirement.
		Why the change? This provision will ensure there is a maintenance record documenting safety equipment testing and repair required by regulation or manufac-turers’ recommendations. These provisions will also ensure that required emergency instruction and drills are being conducted by a qualified individual with crew participation. It will be incumbent upon the master or individual in charge of a commercial fishing vessel to maintain these records onboard the vessel.
		<div class="topic"><em>4.</em> Examinations and Certificates of Compliance:</div>
		 46 U.S.C. §4502(f) is amended to add a requirement that commercial fishing vessels operating beyond 3 nautical miles must be examined dockside at least once every 5 years and be issued a Certificate of Compliance (COC). The 2012 CGMTA further
		amended §4502(f) by requiring that the first such exam for a vessel must be completed not later than October 15, 2015. Section 608 of the CGAA also added authority for the USCG to remove a certificate from a vessel that does not comply with its provisions. Vessels operating without a certificate required by Title 46 U.S.C. may have their voyage terminated. 46 CFR Part 28 will be amended to reflect these requirements and authorities. (Note:The CGAA requirement for a dockside examina-tion at least once every 2 years was changed to at least once every 5 years by the CGMTA.)
		Why the change? Currently, dockside safety exam-inations are voluntary unless a valid safety decal is required for a reason specific to the vessel’s operation, such as vessels subject to carriage of a NOAA Fisheries Observer. Approximately only about 10% of the nation’s estimated active commercial fishing fleet is examined at the dock during a year. Studies have shown that fatalities and vessel losses occur more frequently on, or with those vessels, that have not been examined or its decal has expired. The Coast Guard does not have authority to inspect fishing vessels, so this requirement for safety examinations will guarantee that a good portion of the commercial fishing fleet is checked for compliance with al the safety and survival equipment requirements.
		<div class="topic"><em>5.</em> Training for Commercial FishingVessel Operators:</div>
		The CGAA added subsection, 46 U.S.C. §4502(g), that requires the individual in charge of a com-mercial fishing vessel that operates beyond 3 nautical miles to pass a training program and hold a certificate issued under that program.The
		program must address certain topical areas and it must be based on professional knowledge, skills, and com-petencies.The program also must recognize and give credit to the individual for recent past experience in fishing vessel operation. The training certificate will be valid for 5 years after which refresher training will be required to keep the certificate current. Note: The CGMTA did not change the training and certificate requirements, however, it did amend subsection (g)(4) so that the database listing the names of individuals completing the training need not be publicly accessi-ble. 46 CFR Part 28 will be amended to reflect these requirements.
		Why the change? Most commercial fishing vessel operators are unlicensed. A licensed operator is only required on vessels over 200 gross tons. The train-ing requirement for operators will help ensure their competency to command the vessel. Individuals in charge of a commercial fishing vessel will have to pass a training program or demonstrate knowledge and competency in seamanship, navigation and pub-lications, collision prevention, stability, fire fighting and prevention, damage control, personal survival, emergency medical care, emergency drills, weather, and emergency communication.
		<div class="topic"><em>6.</em> Construction Standards for Newly-Built Smaller Vessels:</div>
		The CGAA added subsection, 46 U.S.C. §4502(h), that requires commercial fishing vessels less than 50 feet overall in length, built after January 1, 2010, to be constructed in a manner that provides a level of safety equiva-
		lent to the minimum safety standards established for recreational vessels. (Note: The CGMTA had no effect on this provision.) 46 CFR Part 28 will be amended to reflect this change, but the requirement is already effective by law. The standards/requirements for rec-reational vessels can be found in 33 CFR Parts 181 and 183.
		Why the change? With respect to smaller commercial fishing vessels in particular, there is little guidance and there are few requirements on how the vessel must be constructed to ensure the safety of the vessel and crew. Construction standards imposed by this pro-vision should improve the integrity of these smaller fishing vessels, and, maintaining the vessel to original construction condition is important to ensure better integrity of a commercial fishing vessel as it ages. Ca-sualty data shows that 67% of vessels lost to flooding result from hull or equipment failure. Construction and maintenance standards that have been needed for smaller commercial fishing vessels are addressed by establishment of this requirement.
		Note: “Overall in length”, means the horizontal distance of the hull between the foremost part of the stem and the aftermost part of the stern excluding fittings and at-tachments.This is different from the “registered length”.
		<div class="topic"><em>7.</em> Load Lines:</div>
		46 U.S.C. §5102(b) is amended to require commercial fishing vessels 79 feet or greater in length to have a load line assigned. Under the CGAA, this provision applied to com-mercial fishing vessels built after July 1, 2012, however, the CGMTA changed the effective date
		to July 1, 2013.
		The CGAA also added a provision that requires fishing vessels that undergo a “substantial change to the di-mension of or type of vessel” after July 1, 2012, or on a date set by the Coast Guard, to comply with an alternate load line compliance program developed in cooperation with the industry. Again, the CGMTA changed the statutorily imposed effective date from July 1, 2012 to July 1, 2013.
		The CGMTA also deleted the phrase “substantial change...” and replaced it with “major conversion.” 46 CFR Part 28 and Part 42 will be amended to reflect these requirements.
		With regard to major conversion determinations, fishing vessels are often modified such that their di-mensions are changed or they are converted to a different type of commercial fishing vessel. When that action is taken, the loading conditions and seaworthiness of the vessel can be affected. Re-evaluation of the water-tight integrity and safe loading capacity of the vessel may be needed and an alternate load line compliance program is to be developed by the Coast Guard in co-operation with the commercial fishing industry. This program should ensure these substantially changed vessels that have undergone a major conversion meet an equivalent standard of safety for the vessel that would have been met if there had been a load line assigned to the vessel.
		Why the change? Generally, most commercial fishing vessels have been exempt from load line requirements. A load line indicates the minimum safe freeboard to which a vessel may be loaded. Conditions evaluated when calculating and assigning a load line include watertight integrity of the vessel, subdivision, and loading capacity. Casualty data has shown that commercial fishing vessels that are overloaded are more vulnerable to loss of stability that can lead to flooding and capsiz-ing, particularly in severe weather or sea conditions. Having and complying with an assigned load line will help ensure safe loading and improved seaworthiness of vessels.
		Note: Major conversion is defined in 46 U.S.C. § 2101(14a) as meaning a conversion of a vessel that: substantially changes the dimensions (e.g. length, breadth, or depth) or carrying capacity of the vessel; changes the type of the vessel; substantially prolongs the life of the vessel; or, otherwise so changes the vessel that it is essentially a new vessel, as decided by the Commandant. Built date can be inferred from definitions provided in the U.S.Code and Regulations for “new” and “existing” vessels where determination is made based on when the keel is laid or the vessel was at a similar stage of construction.
		<div class="topic"><em>8.</em> Classing of Vessels:</div>
		46 U.S.C. §4503 was amended by the 2010 CGAA to add a requirement that com-mercial fishing vessels at least 50 feet overall in length, built after July 1, 2012 that operate beyond 3 nautical miles must be designed, constructed, and maintained to the standards of a recognized classification society.The CGAA also required that vessels classed before July 1, 2012 shall remain subject to the requirements of a classification society and have on board a certificate from that society.The 2012 CGMTA changed the effective date to July 1, 2013 after which if a vessel 50 feet or more in length is built, it must meet survey and classification requirements. Further, the law defines “built” for vessels subject to 46 U.S.C. §4503. 46 CFR Part 28 will be amended to reflect this change, but the requirement will become effective by law and consequently, new commercial fishing vessels, built after July 1, 2013, will be required to meet survey and classification standards.
		Note: The 2012 CGMTA added a subsection (e) to 46 U.S.C. §4503 that states the term “built” means, with respect to a vessel, that the vessel’s construction has reached any of the following stages: (1) The vessel’s keel is laid. (2) Construction identifiable with the vessel has begun and assembly of the vessel has commenced comprising of at least 50 metric tons or one percent of the estimated mass of all structural material, whichever is less.
		<div class="topic"><em>9.</em> Alternate Safety Compliance Program:</div>
		The 2010 CGAA added a subsection (d) to 46 U.S.C. §4503. This provision requires the Coast Guard to pre-scribe and develop, in cooperation with the com-mercial fishing industry, an alternate safety com-pliance program for commercial fishing vessels
		that operate beyond the 3 nautical mile line, if the vessel: is at least 50 feet overall in length, is built before July 1, 2012, and is 25 years of age or older (in 2020); or, is built on or before July 1, 2012, and undergoes a substantial change to the dimension of, or type of vessel, completed after July 1, 2012, or a later date set by the Coast Guard.The 2012 CGMTA changed the dates of applicability from July 1, 2012 to July 1, 2013. Alternate safety compliance programs may be devel-oped for specific regions and fisheries. In general, the alternate safety compliance programs must be pre-scribed by 2017 and implementation begun by 2020. 46 CFR Part 28 will be amended to reflect these re-quirements.
		Why the changes? Casualty data shows that approx-imately two thirds of commercial fishing vessels lost to flooding result from hull or equipment failure; poor maintenance is often a factor.The older the vessel, the more likely it is to experience a catastrophic event. The Coast Guard does not have authority to require inspection of fishing vessels. Except for fish processing vessels built after 1990, commercial fishing vessels have not been required to meet construction standards such as survey and classification requirements.Thus, there has been little authority or ability to enforce con-struction standards and material condition on commer-cial fishing vessels. Standards to ensure a well-built and maintained vessel and application of equivalent safety standards on older and modified commercial fishing vessels are needed to improve the safety of the vessel. Construction and maintenance standards have been needed for some time and had never been fully addressed in the law or regulations previously.
		Note: The meaning of “built” as described in the Note under the “Classing of Vessels” is also applicable to commercial fishing vessels that will be subject to al-ternate safety compliance programs.
		<div class="topic">Clarification of Existing Equipment Requirements:</div>
		Section 604 of the 2010 CGAA also clarified or changed certain existing equipment standards by amending parts of 46 U.S.C. §4502(a) and §4502(b) as noted in the following paragraphs. 46 CFR Part 28 will be amended to reflect these added requirements or changes to ex-isting requirements.
		Applicable to all commercial fishing vessels:
		46 U.S.C. §4502(a) was amended to add a new para-graph (6) that grants authority for the Coast Guard to require “other equipment required to minimize the risk of injury to the crew during vessel operations if the Secretary determines that a risk or serious injury exists that can be eliminated or mitigated by that equip-ment.” (This used to be found as 46 U.S.C. §4502(b)(2) (G) before the amendment.)
		Applicable to commercial fishing vessels operating beyond 3 nautical miles of the baseline of the territorial sea or 3 nautical miles from the coastline of the Great Lakes:
		46 U.S.C. §4502(b)(2)(D) was amended by specifying that radio communication equipment must be “marine radios” for effective communication with land-based search and rescue facilities. This implies that cellular telephones will not be accepted as primary or second-ary emergency communication equipment.
		46 U.S.C. §4502(b)(2)(E) was amended by striking the requirement for “radar reflectors” and “anchors.” The revision added “publications” to the requirement for navigation equipment, compasses and nautical charts. The publications may include U.S. Coast Pilot, Coast Guard Light List, tide tables, and Inland Navigation Rules.
		46 U.S.C. §4502(b)(2)(F) was amend by replacing the requirement for “medicine chests” with “medical sup-plies sufficient for the size and area of operation of the vessel.”This will permit the development of standards for first-aid kits and other emergency medical equip-ment for vessels operating in different areas.
		46 U.S.C. §4502(b)(2)(G) was amended to require “ground tackle sufficient for the vessel.” This would include appropriate anchoring capability for the vessel, a requirement that was deleted by the change made to §4502(b)(2)(E) as noted above. Further, with respect to that change, there are no standards for radar reflectors, and they may not be necessary on most vessels.
		Why the changes? The impact of these changes will be to more accurately reflect equipment that is better suited for and needed in today’s commercial fishing industry for vessels based on their operating areas.
		Note: None of the above changes was affected by the CGMTA.
