					you've got a vibe unlike anyone I've ever met before, and i'm so happy i know you. You're moving 3,000 miles away with a backpack + carry-on and by doing that, you're refusing to settle. That's something that I admire so much about you. You're going to crush it out in california and there's nothing anyone can do to stop you.

					<br><br>I'll miss you a lot, especially if fucking Brody is the new 007 and I have no one to go see it with and yell at the screen about. </br></br>
