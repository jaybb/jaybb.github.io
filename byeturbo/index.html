					happy you're unlike anyone i've ever met before. happy i was able to get to know you while you were here. happy you moved 3,000 miles away with just a backpack and a carry-on. happy you are refusing to settle for something that's easy over something that's going to make you a happier person. 

					<br><br>you're going to crush it out in california, and there's nothing anyone can do to stop you. I miss you a bunch already, and its going to be weird if brody is the new james bond and we can't go see it together.
