				Thad Starner, a wearables pioneer, serves as technical lead for Google Glass, cuts the figure of a casual-chic tech executive. When I meet him at a Google office complex in Mountain View, he turns his laptop toward me and presses Play on an artifact from his deeply unfashionable past. It’s a grainy clip from 60 Minutes in which Morley Safer challenges Starner—then a scraggly-haired kid with a goatee, dark trench coat, and black Ho Ho-sized object affixed to his left eye—to carry out what was then his parlor trick: retrieving any piece of information in 30 seconds.

				“Give me the lifetime average and number of home runs, doubles, singles, and triples of Mickey Mantle,” Safer says.
			</p>
			<p>
				“How do you spell Mantle?” Starner asks. He types the name on a one-handed keyboard and peers into his eye-screen.
			</p>
			<P>
				“I’m getting a lot of hits on that,” he says, a touch of nervousness in his voice.
				“So did he” Safer retorts.
			</p>
			<p>
				The year was 1997, and the task took Starner far longer than he’d hoped. He eventually got there by scouring results on AltaVista, the world’s best search engine at the time: “The right hit was often in the top 14 but not the top one,” Starner now recalls.
			</p>
			<p>
			 	Thirteen years later Starner came to work for the company that finally perfected Internet searching. Google made it significantly easier and faster for people to find the information they were seeking, a process that has only sped up in recent years. Google Search, for example, now not only auto-completes but auto-searches, Starner points out. “You don’t even have to get all the way through your first word and it might have the right piece of information for you.” It all comes down to what Google CEO Larry Page calls “reducing the time between intention and action,” words that Starner calls a mission statement.
			 </p>

			<p>
				“If you can’t get to a tool within two seconds,” he says, “your use of it goes down exponentially.” Even today, smartphones have trouble meeting that standard. By the time we extract them from our skinny jeans, swipe, type a passcode, and find our way to whichever app we wanted, the moment has usually passed.

				When you put on Google Glass—or, say, the Pebble smartwatch, whose unprecedented $10.3 million Kickstarter campaign two years ago arguably helped launch the wearable era—you suddenly have a window into your phone, with your calls, texts, and emails popping up on a glanceable screen as they flow in. In the case of Glass or some of the other smartwatches on the market, you even get a camera and voice recorder to document the world around you.
			</p>
			<p>
				Phil Libin, ceo of the cross-platform note-taking app Evernote sees Google now–like applications as his company’s future. The ultimate effect of these devices, he says, will be to “make you more aware, more mindful. They’ll reduce the number of seconds in the day when you’re confused. That’s what this whole connected universe will do. It will make you a functionally smarter human being”. But This new world of wearables will never arrive if nobody consents to wear them. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A good example of this disconnect between wearable technology and fashion is Google Glass. The problem with Google Glass is not that it’s bad industrial design. Google has learned a great deal about how to make an aesthetically pleasing product. But Glass is meant to be a highly visible addition to someone’s body as they walk around in public. That demands more than just a gorgeous product; it demands a fashionable product. And the tricky task of wearables makers will be to understand the distinction.
			</p>
			<p>
				One can boil that difference down to two basic rules. The first is what we might call the Bluedouche principle. For those who don’t remember the term, it’s an epithet hurled circa 2007 at anyone who walked around talking on a Bluetooth earpiece all day. For all their functionality, and for all the attempts to make more stylish models, earpieces have never succeeded in shedding this fundamental perception of lameness. That’s because wearing technology sends a pointed social message, which can render even the best industrial design superfluous.
			</p>
			<p>
				Consider: However gorgeous a Bluetooth earpiece, it fundamentally says that its wearer might need to make or receive a call at any time—and for most people, that’s not a cool message to send.
			</p>
	 		<p>
	 			It makes the wearer look like they jump at the world’s beck and call rather than engaging with it on their own terms. It’s hardly coincidental that the demographics in which the earpieces seem to have caught on, tend to value that kind of always-on hustling. Similarly, successful wearable devices will need to convey a message to the world that the wearer is happy to send—even if the batteries are dead.

			<p>
			If the first rule presents a challenge for wearables as they gain acceptance, the second will present a problem once they really take off. Here’s yet another way the design lessons of the smartphone era won’t apply in the wearables age. If you walk into a business meeting where everyone has the same phone as you, you’re not likely to care very much. But what if you walked into that same meeting and five other people were wearing the exact same eyeglasses as you? You might as well all be wearing the same trucker hat.
		</p>
		<p>
			In these early days, it’s the Bluedouche problem—the social message that our wearable tech is sending—that most needs to be ovecome. That’s why some of the most promising devices today are simple, targeted products that allow for more elegant form factors and a more streamlined sales pitch. Sonny Vu, CEO of Misfit Wearables, a startup dedicated to creating devices that truly deserve to be called fashionable, calls this use-case engineering, meaning a tight focus on one particular function, such as notifications. “Right now what we’re seeing with smartwatches is that they’re like smartphones you can wear on your wrist,” Vu says. “I don’t think that’s the way to go.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Based on early reviews, though, this maximalist approach has possibly been a mistake. “Nobody will buy this watch, and nobody should,” sniffed former New York Times columnist David Pogue in a representative review. 
			</p>
			<p>Not long ago in New York, I visited the SoHo showroom of a boutique watchmaker called House of Horology. There I met the two principal collaborators behind the Agent smartwatch, a Kickstarter campaign, whose first units are scheduled to ship in early 2014 and who personify the coming merger of tech and fashion. Indeed, the two men embody their respective realms almost comically. The tech brains and prime mover behind the Agent project is Chris Walker, 35, and the style is supplied by Lawrence Leyderman, House of Horology’s 31-year-old proprietor, and New York native.
			</p>
			<p>Walker already knew he wanted to build a fashionable smartwatch when he stumbled across the store last January. He suggested a partnership, and Leyderman began developing his take on the design: a chunky, vaguely military-looking frame cast in metal with an irregular 12-sided face, plus a thick leather or rubber strap with contrast stitching. Today the two are putting the finishing touches on Agent, which they ambitiously imagine as the world’s best smartwatch along just about every dimension: function, stability, security, and—best of all—coolness.

			<p>“Capturing people’s imagination in a way that makes them want to put your stuff on their body is a skill set that not many people have,” Brunner says. “It definitely doesn’t exist in many large corporations.” Tech companies havent seemed to get that stuff. Then again, they might now be ready to learn. In just the past year, Apple alone has hired executives from Burberry, Levi Strauss, and Yves Saint Laurent—in the last case, to head up a “special projects” division that many suspect will wind up creating wearable devices.
			</p>
			<p>Sonny Vu, says “It feels like 2003 of the mobile era”—that is, right before smartphones came along to invent a new category. A pessimist, pondering the reaction to Google Glass and the Galaxy Gear, might counter that it’s more like 1993, when Apple’s Newton showed the capabilities of mobile devices long before the public was prepared for it. But the barrier this time is the unique challenge of creating something that is not just functional or even beautiful but deeply personal. The wearable future will be here someday. The only question is how soon you’ll be willing to put it on.
